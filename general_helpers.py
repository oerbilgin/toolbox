def load_dataframe(fname, filetype=None, key=None):
    """
    Uses the appropriate pandas function to load a file based on the
    file extension:
    .pkl or .pickle: pickle file
    .xls or .xlsx: excel file
    .csv: comma separated file
    .txt, .tab, or .tsv: tab separated file
    .h5 or .hdf5: HDF5 formatted files. To load these, you must also
                  pass a key argument!

    Inputs
    ------
    fname: path to the file to be loaded as a pandas dataframe
    filetype: Used to override the autodetection of a filetype based on
              its file extension. Accepts file extensions listed above,
              but without the preceding "." (e.g. pass it "pkl")
    key: They key for the table to be loaded in the HDF5 file. Only
         required/used when loading HDF5 tables. 

    Outputs
    -------
    df: the loaded pandas dataframe

    WARNING: for binary file types (pickle and hdf5), be wary of
    saving and loading from different versions of pandas, as this will
    very likely break the loader.
